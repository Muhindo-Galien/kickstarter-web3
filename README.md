## Overview

**KickstartDApp** revolutionizes the fundraising landscape for developers, offering a decentralized platform where innovators can breathe life into their projects through community-backed support. In a world driven by innovation, developers often face financial constraints to bring their ideas to fruition. KickstartDApp bridges this gap by providing a decentralized fundraising solution built on the Filecoin (FIL) blockchain.

## How It Works

   The heart of KickstartDApp lies in community support. Fellow developers, enthusiasts, and backers can contribute to a campaign by donating tFIL (Tokenized Filecoin). This peer-to-peer contribution system ensures that projects receive support directly from the community, fostering a sense of shared ownership.

3. **Platform Fee:**
   KickstartDApp operates with a minimal 10% platform fee. This fee is essential for maintaining and further enhancing the platform, ensuring its sustainability and continuous support for developers. The transparent fee structure is disclosed upfront, promoting fairness and trust.
